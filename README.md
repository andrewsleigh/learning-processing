# Learning Processing

I'm trying to learn Processing. This is where I'm sharing my progress and my code.


## Purpose of this documentation

1. A live journal of work in progress, capturing what I've done; what I'm stuck on; what I've learned
2. A public shared project that others could be part of. By sharing this journey in public, I'd like to meet other people who are trying to do similar things. Can we build this together?
3. A useful open-source resource for the community. Everything here is MIT-licensed (basically, do what you like with it)


## Taking part

If you're learning Processing, I hope you find this useful. Maybe some of the things that I've struggled with as a beginner will help you overcome the same obstacles. Maybe you can help me with some of the things I'm stuck on.

## What I need

Can you help me fill in the gaps. Do you have an idea for an exercise that would help others learn Processing? Are there mistakes you can correct? Yes, I'm sure there are!
